Important information when transiting via another country to/from TLV
Travel between TLV and other countries is at the customer’s own expense. If transiting another country:  

•    Agencies need to ticket separately and not in the United PNR.

•    Ensure minimum connecting time for that airport is met as travelers need to go through the arrival process before checking in for the connection.

•    Customers need to check in, collect baggage, and re-check baggage with the other airline in the alternate city for onward travel. Through check-in and bag transfers are not permitted.

•    Customers must hold required documentation to transit via that country.
