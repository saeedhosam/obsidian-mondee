- Ancillary products (including Protect): A refund request must be submitted to salesus@elal.co.il.
- Partially used ticket: A proportional refund will be issued for the unused portion of the ticket. Partial refunds must be processed via the GDS.

Note:

- This policy will be extended and adjusted as needed based on developments.
- Actions can be performed independently through distribution systems.

### Important Note

Passengers currently abroad and waiting for a recovery flight should not cancel or request a partial refund for their ticket, even if the original flight was canceled.

If a cancellation or partial refund has already been processed for a booking and the passengers are still waiting for a recovery flight, the original booking number must be entered in the registration form.
