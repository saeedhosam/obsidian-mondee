## Using Tasks

There are 4 main sections in Google Tasks that are convenient to be used.

- Pending: Where the messages with no reply reside, at the same time where you're not intending to work on this message now.
- To Do: The email you're currently working on.
- Waiting Response: The emails you're waiting a response for whether from a client or the airline
- To Review: Cases which are done but still needs to be reviewed.

It is crucial to check all the tasks every now and then, believe me it really is.
